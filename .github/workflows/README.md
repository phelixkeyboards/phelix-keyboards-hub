# Running Workflows Locally with `act`

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows that can be executed locally using `act`. `act` is a command-line tool that allows you to run GitHub Actions workflows locally, providing a fast and convenient way to test your workflows before pushing changes to your repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run workflows locally with `act`, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [act](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation)

## Running Workflows

To run a workflow locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Change into the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the workflow using `act`:

    ```bash
    act
    ```

    This command will execute the default workflow defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.

    If you want to run a specific workflow, you can specify it using the `--workflow` flag:

    ```bash
    act --workflow my-workflow.yml -P self-hosted=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
    ```

    Replace `my-workflow.yml` with the name of the workflow file you want to run.

That's it! You can now run GitHub Actions workflows locally using `act`. This allows you to test and debug your workflows before pushing changes to your repository.

For more information on using `act`, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/nektos/act).
